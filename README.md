# Local hydra, with a single script

This is adapted from [hydra in a web page](https://hydra.ojack.xyz/docs/docs/learning/extending-hydra/hydra-in-a-webpage/).


In a new directory...

```
npm install --save hydra-synth
```

Then use the source code in `first.html`.

The source in that file is adapted from https://glitch.com/edit/#!/hydra-webpage
